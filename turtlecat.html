                <h3>Green Turtle (Chelonia Mydas)</h3>
                <p>Green turtles are the most abundant and most cmmon nesting species, that can weigh up to 230 kg and are typically 1 meter long. The Indian, Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific Oceans are just a few examples of the tropical and subtropical oceans where they can be found migrating. Turtle soup, a delicacy in many parts of the world, is made from green turtles that are trapped and slaughtered. The color of the fat found beneath their shells, which is utilized to produce the soup, is referenced in their English name. Young green turtles eat mostly meat. Although the adults are carnivorous, they only consume marine plants like seagrass and algae. The status of green turtles is currently listed as "Endangered."</p>

                <h3>Olive Ridley</h3>
                <p>Olive Ridley is the smallest marine turtle. The adults are less than 40kg in weight and can reach a length of 65cm. The south Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans are where you can find them most frequently. They consume a variety of foods, including fish, crustaceans, and some marine flora. Currently, Olive Ridley turtles are classified as a "Endangered" species. Arribada: Olive Ridley turtles nest on beaches in a few nations, where this mass gathering is known as a "Arribada." This Spanish phrase translates to "the arrival." For instance, 600,000 Olive Ridley turtles have been observed nesting in India over a few weeks on the same beach. Olive Ridley turtles are threatened even though their populations appear to be large. This is due to the fact that a major portion of this species' population is dependent on the safety of a select few significant beaches for breeding.</p>

                <h3>Hawksbill Turtle</h3>
                <p>Hawksbill turtles are relatively small turtles and are considered to be critically endangered. Adults often weigh around 60 kg and are up to 90 cm tall. They typically consume carnivorous animals and live in tropical coastal waters near coral reefs. They eat many different kinds of creatures, including as jellyfish, sponges, and crabs. The tiny, bird-like beak that the hawksbill turtle uses to capture prey that is lurking in small crevices gives it its English name. In some cases, hawksbill turtles ingest poisonous sponges. Hawksbills may actually store the toxins in their own skin, so they aren't poisoned in the first place. A human who consumes the meat of a Hawksbill turtle risked passing away from severe food sickness. Because people have been killing hawksbill turtles for their shell for ages, their numbers are currently extremely low. The shell is transformed into "tortoise shell" decorations after being cleaned and polished. </p>

                <h3>Leatherback Turtle</h3>
                <p>Leatherback turtles are the largest marine turtles. They do nest in Sri Lanka but mostly found in Andaman and Nicobar islands in the Noth Indian Ocean. They can grow to be longer than 2 meters and often weigh around 600 kg. 918 kg was the weight of the biggest Leatherback ever discovered! They have a primarily black dorsal color with varying amounts of white or lighter markings. Pinkish spots may appear on the neck. The only food source for leatherbacks is jellyfish, and they will travel great distances in quest of their meal. In contrast to other turtles, leatherbacks can regulate their own body temperature because layers of fatty tissue insulate their bodies, allowing them to survive in the extreme cold where they have been spotted feasting on jellyfish in Arctic Circle waters. Their distinctive carapace is what gives them the name "Leatherback" in English. To find deep-sea jellyfish, leatherback turtles can scuba dive to depths of up to 1500 meters. The Leatherback's body experiences extreme water pressure at these depths, but because of its flexible shell, which resists breaking, the turtle may safely eat. The status of leatherback turtles is currently listed as "Critically Endangered."</p>

                <h3>Loggerhead Turtle</h3>
                <p>Loggerhead turtles can reach lengths of 1 m and weights of 180 kg. In addition to nesting on tropical beaches, this species also uses beaches in several temperate regions, including the Mediterranean and the South East coast of the United States. Even though this species is among the most widespread in the entire planet, it is the least common nesting species in Sri Lanka. It is crucial to act immediately to safeguard the Loggerhead turtles in Sri Lanka since they are only found there, are from the Indian subcontinent, and have distinctive coloring that suggests a distinct population with unique DNA. Loggerhead turtles eat mostly crustaceans and mollusks because they are carnivorous. The term "Loggerhead" refers to the big head that houses a powerful pair of jaws that are perfect for chopping up mollusks and crustaceans.</p>
