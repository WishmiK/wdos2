                <h3>Natural Threats</h3>
            </div>
            <img src="Images/predators.jpeg" alt="predators img">
            <p>The primary natural dangers to sea turtles come from predators such jackals, wild boars, mongooses, stray dogs, water monitors, and land monitors. 
                On nesting beaches, species of ants and crabs can be thought of as natural predators of marine turtle eggs and hatchlings. 
                Hatchlings in the sea are preyed upon by killer whales, orca whales, sharks, other reef fish, and seabirds. 
                Sometimes severe weather events like hurricanes, tornadoes, draughts, and the El Nino phenomena can harm turtle nests that have already been laid.</p>

                <h3>Man-Made Threats</h3>
            </div>
            <img src="Images/bycatch.jpeg" width="270" height="180" alt="bycatch of fishing">

            <ol type="1">
                <li><h4>Killing for meat</h4>
                    <p>In several nations, marine turtles are killed for their meat. In several coastal regions of Sri Lanka, killing sea turtles for their meat is a normal practice. The killing of mature female turtles that are nesting has a direct impact on the population decline. The fishermen often kill live turtles caught in fishing gear for their meat.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>Killing for shell</h4>
                    <p>To supply raw materials for the "tortoise shell" trade, the severely endangered Hawksbill turtle is killed all over the world for its stunning shell or carapace. The turtle eventually perishes when the scutes are removed from its shell. There are now synthetic fibers with colors and patterns that resemble tortoise shell. For the benefit of hawksbill turtles, synthetic fibers with comparable color patterns can now be used in place of tortoise shell raw materials.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>Poaching</h4>
                    <p>Illegal turtle egg harvesting is one of the most common methods of exploiting sea turtles. Egg collectors who grab the eggs and sell them have an easy target because female turtles come ashore to lay their eggs. With the exception of areas where conservation programs are in place, all marine turtle nests on Sri Lankan beaches have their eggs stolen. The eggs are either sold at markets for consumption or to turtle hatcheries.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>By catch</h4>
                    <p>During fishing operations, turtles are a bycatch. They are reptiles that come to the surface to breathe air since they have lungs. They become trapped in nets and perish. This happens to more than 5000 turtles, some of whom drown and pass away. Only a few people are saved.</p>

                <h3>Habitat Destruction</h3>
            </div>
           
            <p>Due to overexploitation, man has damaged crucial marine turtle ecosystems all over the world, including coral reefs, sea grass beds, mangroves, sand dunes, and beach vegetation. Coral mining is one of the main methods of habitat destruction. Coral reefs offer marine turtles an essential habitat for feeding and relaxation in addition to acting as an essential sea erosion barrier for the beaches where the turtles lay their eggs. Unsustainable harvesting is destroying Sri Lanka's coral reefs.</p>

                <h3>Marine Pollution </h3>
                
                <p>Many sea turtles die as a result of marine pollution. Leatherback turtles consume jellyfish, and as they frequently mistake floating plastic bags for jellyfish, the animals starve to death as the bags block their digestive tracts.
                    In addition, a condition known as ''Fibropapilloma'' that resembles a tumor is a major killer of marine turtles. This illness is thought to be brought on by marine contaminants. Fibropapilloma is not currently present in Sri Lanka's turtle populations, nevertheless.</p>

            <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Participate in beach cleanups to always keep the beaches clean.</li>
                <li>Be conscious nesting places of the turtles when walking on the beaches. </li>
                <li>Don't abandon your fihsing gear. Hooks and nets can entangle turtles.</li>
