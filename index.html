                <h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
                <p>Sea turtles are one of the most endagered species in the world with only seven species of them remaining. However, the Pearl Island,Sri Lanka is blessed to have 5 of the 7 species grace its waters and shores to breed. Green turtles, Olive Ridley, Hawksbill turtle, Leatherback and Loggerhead are these 5 categories.</p>

            <h3><u>Turtle Conservation Project (TCP) </u></h3>
            <p>The Turtle Conservation Project (TCP) was founded in Sri Lanka in 1993 with the intention of developing and facilitating the implementation of sustainable marine turtle conservation measures through community involvement, research, and teaching. To achieve its vision of "Sustainable level for sea turtle populations in Sri Lanka," the TCP's mission is to carry out research, surveys, education and awareness programs, and community-based conservation and management programs. The TCP has started a variety of community-based ecosystem approach conservation programmes, such as in-situ marine turtle nest protection and research, mangrove rehabilitation, community libraries, community primary schools, and environmental education programs. TCP maintains field stations and offices at Rekawa, Tangalle, Panadura, Kandakkuliya, and Kosgoda to aid in the continuation of the activities that were initially started.</p>

                    <li>The hatchery must have a detailed monitoring and evaluation system, maintaining data on the number of nests and eggs and the percentage of eggs that hatch succesfully.</li>
                    <li>They must use additional measures such as tagging the nesting turtles, measuring them and so on.</li>
                    <li>There must be evidence of wider conservation initiatives both for the beach and marine environments and with local communities.</li>

                        <li>Turtles are among the world's oldest groups of reptiles having lived nearly 200 million years.</li>
                        <li>Despite the common belief, it's impossible for a turtle to come out of its shell as it grows with them.</li>
                        <li>Many baby turtles start as carnivores but tend to eat more plants as they mature.</li>
                        <li>These cold blodded creatures have a long life span, the oldest having lived 188 years!</li>
                        <li>The shell of the turtle is actually a portion of its skeleton, which consists of about 50 bones, including the turtle's spine and rib cage.</li>

                        <br>
                        <p>Ex-situ Conservation refers to the preservation of turtles outside their natural environments. Turtle hatcheries are responsible for ex-situ conservation of sea turtles. Hatchery owners purchase eggs from egg collectors and rebury them in a secure location. In that location, the eggs are incubated, hatch and subsequently hatchlings are born. The hatchlings are gathered and held in tanks for a short period of tie before being released.</p>

                        <h5>In-situ Conservation</h5>
                        <br>
                        <p>In-situ Conservation is known as the most organic kind of conservation. Sea turtles' native habitats must be preserved in order for them to continue existing through natural selection. The natural environment is preseved with the least possible human impact. This conservation type is ecologically sensitive to the behaviours of the nesting female turtles and the hatchling turtles. The nesting female turtle's eventual nesting location selection critieria is said to be based on some instinctual factor requirments that only she is aware of. The daily beach patrols and observation of nesting activities is implimented in in-situ. To learn more about the local population of marine turtles, biometric data gathering and turtle tagging could also be used.</p>
